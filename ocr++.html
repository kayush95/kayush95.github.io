                OCR++: A Robust Framework For Information Extraction from Scholarly Articles
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Guide: </b><a href="http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pawang/">Prof. Pawan Goyal</a></li>
                    <li><b>Abstract:</b> This paper proposes OCR++, an open-source framework designed for a variety of information
                    extraction tasks from scholarly articles including metadata (title, author names, affiliation and
                    e-mail), structure (section headings and body text, table and figure headings, URLs and footnotes) and bibliography (citation instances and references). We analyze a diverse set of scientific
                    articles written in English language to understand generic writing patterns and formulate rules
                    to  develop  this  hybrid  framework.   Extensive  evaluations  show  that  the  proposed  framework
                    outperforms the existing state-of-the-art tools with huge margin in structural information extraction along with improved performance in metadata and bibliography extraction tasks,  both in
                    terms of accuracy (around 50% improvement) and processing time (around 52% improvement).
                    A user experience study conducted with the help of 30 researchers reveals that the researchers
                    found this system to be very helpful. As an additional objective, we discuss two novel use cases
                    including automatically extracting links to public datasets from the proceedings, which would
                    further accelerate the advancement in digital libraries.  The result of the framework can be exported as a whole into structured TEI-encoded documents.  Our framework is accessible online
                    at <a href="http://www.cnergres.iitkgp.ac.in/OCR++/home/">this URL</a>.</li>
                    <li>OCR++ bagged the <b>third prize</b> at <a href="http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/conf/IBM/">IBM Day</a> 2016 (system demonstartion contest) at IIT Kharagpur.</li>
                    <li>OCR++ was also felicitated by <b>Flipkart</b> as the <b>best term project</b> of <b>Speech and Natural Language Processing</b> course in fall 2015.</li>
