                PCF-based models for Performance Enhancement of Double Channel 802.11n WLAN
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Abstract</b>: Wi-Fi  enabled  hand-held  devices  quickly  occupied
                        the  consumer  market  as  a  result  of  the  remarkable  customer
                        acceptance  of  IEEE  802.11  standard.  But  the  widely-used  con-
                        tention   based   medium   access   mechanism   is   unable   to   meet
                        the  increasing  traffic  demand  of  todays  home  users.  Especially,
                        delay  sensitive  multimedia  contents  suffer  heavily  from  quality
                        degradation  under  high  traffic  load.  To  cope  with  increasing
                        throughput requirements, and to take advantage of improvements
                        in  hardware  performance,  802.11n  has  been  introduced,  which
                        is modelled solely on the basis of DCF-based contention periods.
                        However,  the  time  synchronized  medium  access  mechanism  of
                        802.11  called  PCF  offers  lower  delay  and  loss,  and  holds  true
                        potential in supporting high traffic load. For design and planning
                        of such networks, a thorough performance analysis of PCF based
                        802.11  WLANs  is  of  profound  importance.  In  this  paper,  we
                        attempt to propose a modification to the double channel 802.11n
                        architecture by introducing PCF-based Contention-Free Periods
                        between the DCF-based contention cycles to allow the central AP
                        to  relieve  the  starving  node.</li>
